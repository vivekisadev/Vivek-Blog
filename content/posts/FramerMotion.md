# Framer Motion - A godlike webstie containing animated elements with their source code and implementation

Framer Motion is a powerful animation library for React that allows developers to create smooth and interactive animations with a simple and declarative syntax.
It provides a high-level API that simplifies adding animations and gestures while keeping the code minimal and readable.
Framer Motion integrates seamlessly with React and offers features like gesture handling, layout animations, and drag animations, making it a preferred choice for building fluid UI interactions, dynamic animations, and responsive user experiences.
The library uses motion components, which are similar to standard JSX elements but come with special animation props such as animate, transition, hover, and tap gestures.
