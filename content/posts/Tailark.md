# Beyond the Template: Why Custom-Made Elements are the Future of Web Design

As a developer, I feel like I'm in a constant battle between speed and quality. Do I build a UI from scratch to get it just right? Or do I use a component library to move faster, even if it means compromising on a unique look? It’s a familiar struggle.

Well, last week I stumbled upon a website that feels like a genuine solution to this problem, and I’m so excited about it that I had to share. It's called Tailark.

What is Tailark? My First Impression
At first glance, Tailark looks like a gallery of beautifully designed website elements—hero sections, navigation bars, feature grids, pricing tables, you name it. The designs are clean, modern, and professional.

My initial thought was, "Okay, another component library." But as I dug deeper, I realized I was wrong. This is where the magic happens.

The "Aha!" Moment: How It Actually Works
Here's the key learning for me: Tailark isn't a library you install as a dependency.

Instead, it’s built following the same philosophy as the hugely popular shadcn/ui. You browse their collection, find a component you need, and you copy the code directly into your own project.


## Why is this a game-changer?

You Own the Code: The component code lives inside your project. You have 100% control to change anything you want, from the smallest style detail to the entire structure. No more fighting with library defaults!

No Unnecessary Bloat: You only add the code for the components you actually use. Your project stays lean and fast.

Built on Tech You Know: The components are built with Tailwind CSS. This means if you know Tailwind, you already know how to customize everything. It’s incredibly intuitive.


## Here was my exact workflow:

I went to the Tailark website and navigated to the "Hero Sections."

I found a clean, two-column layout that I liked.

I clicked the "Code" tab. It showed me the clean, readable React/JSX code.

I copied the code and pasted it into a new component file in my Next.js application.

Instantly, it worked.

From there, customization was a breeze. I changed the heading text, updated the call-to-action button, and swapped the placeholder image with my own. Because it was all just standard HTML elements and Tailwind CSS classes, it felt less like I was using a library and more like I had a super-fast assistant who did all the initial heavy lifting for me.

What would have taken me an hour or two of fiddling with divs and flexbox took me less than 10 minutes.
