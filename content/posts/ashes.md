Swaha: [ashes](https://secret.ashes.cloud/)

Swaha - is a minimal web app I designed and built to help people let go of their burdens. The idea is simple:
You type your secret or something that’s been weighing on your mind — and watch it burn away.

None of the input is stored or shared. It’s not about data; it’s about release.

The goal is emotional — to give people a small, private moment of relief, like writing something down and watching it vanish. The site includes subtle details, animations, and even a few hidden easter eggs to make it feel more human — not like just another cold, mechanical tool.

Built for people who just need a quiet space to let go.
