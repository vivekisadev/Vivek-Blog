I have known the world in passing,
its colors, faces, shifting skies —
but none have held me
the way your light does.

I am the sunflower
in a field of distractions,
yet every stem in me turns
only to you.

Even when shadows fall,
and the world forgets the sun,
my heart still leans your way —
as if devotion
were a direction,
and you, my true north of warmth.
