**Just had a thought :**

You known my thoughts, I've shared them all,
They stay in the quite moments we recall,
But somehow, the truth still slips away,
Hidden in the words I struggle to say.

But you don't see or perhaps don't feel,
The depths of what I wish to reveal,
A love so strong strong , it shakes my core,
Yet leaves me yearning, wanting more.
